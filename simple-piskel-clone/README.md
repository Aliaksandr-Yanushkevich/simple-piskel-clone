### Description
Simple web page to show weather forecast around the world. After first start application shows you forecast in your city (your location is calculated with IP). If you want to know the forecast in other place - type city in search field or use voice search. You have ability to choose language (EN, BE, RU) and switch temperature units (celsius or fahrenheit). Background of application is changing after each searching or refreshing the page (I use your search query, the time of year and time of day for more relevant getting of background)  In addition, voice commands are available (currently this feature doesn't works perfectly but I have been working on it):

- to change background: 'cмени фон', 'змяні фон', 'change background';
- to choose ENG language: 'английский язык', 'английская мова', 'english language';
- to choose BE language: 'белорусский язык', 'беларуская мова', 'belarusian language';
- to choose RU language: 'русский язык', 'русская мова', 'russian language';
- to show temperature in celsius: 'градусы цельсия', 'градусы цельсия', 'degrees celsius';
- to show temperature in fahrenheit: 'градусы фаренгейта', 'градусы фарэнгейта', 'degrees fahrenheit'
